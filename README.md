# Installation

## Choose package manager
After installation you are asked to choose a package manager. The default package manager is yarn. You can type either `npm` or `yarn`. Any wrong input will default to yarn. The workflow files are adjusted based on this setting to use either npm or yarn.

## Angular Project Name
